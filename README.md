## Project Description
After receiving a cookies dataset, we had to assamble a Machine Learning model in order to predict cookie qualities.

## Dataset

We were given a 16 column dataset with cookies characteristics and around 5000 observations. The target variable was the Quality of the cookies.

## Workflow
- Understanding Dataset
- Wrangling Data
- Design Data Preproc Pipelines
- Assamble ML Models

## Organization

-In order to develop our model, we worked as a team during all stages of the workflow. For the data cleaning and preprocessing, the decisions were took as a group through a meeting.
Once the preprocessing pipeline was ready, the remaining tasks and models training were divided into each component of the group.
